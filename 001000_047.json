{"needle": "\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n", "haystack": "October 2015When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or\n9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.\nAssuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth\nis what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to\nprofitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more\ndramatically, by default do they live or die?The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.\nHalf the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive\nor default dead.If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy\ncalculator you can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive\nor default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the\nanswer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious\nnew things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need\nto talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends\nbadly.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default\ndead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.\nIt's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than\nit makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support\nhimself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from\nmeaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people\nby surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too\nlate whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too\nearly.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches\npolarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying\ntoo early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to\nstart worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the\nfatal pinch.\nThe fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough\ntime to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing\nthat's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're\ndefault alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise\nmore money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the\nmore you depend on it, the falser it becomes.Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking\nof the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.\nSay \"We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save\nus.\" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your\nhead that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently\nearly, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors\nsaving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of\ngrowth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you\ncan start to count on investors being interested even if you're not\nprofitable.\n[1]\nBut investors are so fickle that you can never\ndo more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your\nbusiness will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no\nmatter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising\nas more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you\nshould know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to\nsurvive if you can't raise more money,", "context_length": 1000, "depth_percent": 47}
